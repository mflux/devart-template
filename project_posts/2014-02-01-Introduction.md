Metamorph is a continuation of my previous explorations into artificial life, procedural animation, drawing, and how these ideas intersect. 

##Introduction

My last foray into these ideas was called [Manifest](http://classes.design.ucla.edu/Spring05/152BC/projects/chang/manifest.htm "Manifest"), way back in 2005, shortly before my graduation from UCLA Design Media Arts under the tutelage of Casey Reas. 

The root of the idea came from many sources, one of which was deep sea fish, and microscopic life.

Their symmetry and skeletal makeup seemed ripe for simulation. I didn't need to worry about the fat and muscle tissue, just their apparent outline, their spinal chord, and their skulls. 

It was at this time I was also obssessed with Karl Sims' Evolving Virtual Creatures.

This was how Manifest came into being.

It allowed the user to draw lines, the length of which generated a creature. Loops would generate flora, while long winding lines would end up creating a beefy giant creature that could barely fit on-screen.

One of my biggest gripes about this project was that the creatures had been pre-defined by myself. I was the artist here, and the user merely instancing these creations into reality. The user therefore had very little to do with their creation, they only had the responsibility of firing up something that I had already planned.

To get around this, we have to actually let the user create with whatever line they choose to draw, and actually control the shape and form of these creatures.
